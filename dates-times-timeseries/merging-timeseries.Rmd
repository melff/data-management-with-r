# Merging (multivariate) time series

```{r}
options(jupyter.rich_display=FALSE) # Create output as usual in R
```

The following makes use of the *zoo* package. You may need to install it from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zoo) using the code
`install.packages("zoo")` if you want to run this on your computer. (The
package is already installed on the notebook container, however.)

```{r}
library(zoo)
```

The file "zpresidents.RData" was created in an earlier example.

```{r}
load("unemployment-z.RData")
```

```{r}
Netherlands <- unemployment.z[,4]
length(Netherlands)
```

```{r}
Belgium <- unemployment.z[,5]
length(Belgium)
```

```{r}
Luxembourg <- na.omit(unemployment.z[,6])
length(Luxembourg)
```

```{r}
unemployment.benelux <- merge(Netherlands,
                              Belgium,
                              Luxembourg)
head(unemployment.benelux,n=10)
```
