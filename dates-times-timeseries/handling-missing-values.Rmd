# Handling missing values

```

The following makes use of the *zoo* package. You may need to install it from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zoo) using the code
`install.packages("zoo")` if you want to run this on your computer. (The
package is already installed on the notebook container, however.)

```{r}
library(zoo)
```

The file "zpresidents.RData" was created in an earlier example.

```{r}
load("zpresidents.RData")
```

```{r}
# Leads to an error:
presidents.o <- na.omit(presidents)
```

```{r}
zpresidents.o <- na.omit(zpresidents)
```

```{r}
c("Original length" = length(zpresidents),
  "Length after dropping NAs"  = length(zpresidents.o))
```

```{r}
plot(zpresidents,lty=3)
lines(na.contiguous(zpresidents),lwd=2)
```

```{r}
plot(zpresidents,lwd=2)
lines(na.approx(zpresidents),lty=2)
lines(na.spline(zpresidents),lty=3)
```
