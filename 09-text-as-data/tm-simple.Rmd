# A simple example for the usage of the *tm* package

```{r}
options(jupyter.rich_display=FALSE) # Create output as usual in R
```

The following makes use of the *tm* package. You may need to install it from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tm) using the code
`install.packages("tm")` if you want to run this on your computer. (The
package is already installed on the notebook container, however.)

```{r}
# Activating the 'tm' package
library(tm)
```

```{r}
# We activate the 'acq' data, a corpus of 50 example news articles
data(acq)
acq
```

```{r}
# We take a look at the first element in the corpus, a text document:
class(acq[[1]])
```

```{r}
acq[[1]]
```

```{r}
inspect(acq[[1]])
```

```{r}
# We take a look at the document metadata
meta(acq[[1]])
```

```{r}
DublinCore(acq[[1]])
```
