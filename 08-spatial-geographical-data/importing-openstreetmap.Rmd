# Importing geographical data from OpenStreetMap 


The following makes use of the *sf* package. You may need to install it from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) using the code
`install.packages("sf")` if you want to run this on your computer. (The
package is already installed on the notebook container, however.)

```{r}
library(sf)
```

The file used here was extracted by hand from http://www.openstreetmap.org. It is available from [here](http://github.com/melff/dataman-r/main/spatial-geographical-data/stpauls.osm).

```{r}
st_layers("stpauls.osm")
```

```{r}
stpauls_lines <- st_read("stpauls.osm",layer="lines")
```

```{r}
stpauls_polygons <- st_read("stpauls.osm",layer="multipolygons")
```

```{r}
# Plotting the polygons ...
plot(st_geometry(stpauls_polygons),
     col="gray80",
     xlim=c(-0.1,-0.097),
     ylim=c(51.5135,51.514)
     )
# and adding the lines
plot(st_geometry(stpauls_lines),add=TRUE)
```
