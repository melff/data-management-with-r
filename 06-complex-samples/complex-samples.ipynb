    "# Data from Complex Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from social science surveys often come from complex samples. In order to achieve efficient or at least accurate inference one may need to take into account the sampling design in the computation of sample summaries, e.g. by the application of sampling weights. The chapter shows how the _survey_ package can help to take into account the sampling design in data management and data analysis.\n",
