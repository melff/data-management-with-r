    "This chapter introduces the extension package _memisc_, which is specifically designed to address several of the challenges that were discussed in the previous chapter. It shows how a the system memory can be saved by importing subsets of variables and observations; how variables can be renamed so that results are more easy to interpret; how certain metadata can be used, that are not provided for by a basic _R_ installation, such as value labels and user-defined missing values. The chapter also provides examples for more complex recodings of variables, e.g. for the construction of Goldthorpe class categories for households from ISCO-coded occupations of survey respondents and the creation of codebooks.\n",
