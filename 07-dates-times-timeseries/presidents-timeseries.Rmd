# Approval of US presidents


The following line is not really necessary, it is used here only to indicate
that `presidents` is a pre-installed data example.

```{r}
data(presidents)
```

The data contains quarterly data about presidents' popularity. 
The function `tsp()` contains the time series properties: the starting point,
the end point and the frequency in which the popularity is measured within years.

```{r}
tsp(presidents)
```

With  the functions `start()`, `end()` and `frequency()` we can obtain the
respective time series properties.

```{r}
start(presidents)
```

```{r}
end(presidents)
```

```{r}
frequency(presidents)
```

```{r}
presidents[1:12]
```

```{r}
window(presidents,
       start=1945,
       end=c(1947,4))
```

```{r}
nixon <- window(presidents,
                start=1969,
                end=c(1974,2))
nixon
```

```{r}
plot(nixon)
```

```{r}
time(nixon)
```
