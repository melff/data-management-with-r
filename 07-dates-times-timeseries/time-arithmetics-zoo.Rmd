# Time arithmetics with "zoo" objects

```{r}
options(jupyter.rich_display=FALSE) # Create output as usual in R
```

The following makes use of the *zoo* package. You may need to install it from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=zoo) using the code
`install.packages("zoo")` if you want to run this on your computer. (The
package is already installed on the notebook container, however.)

```{r}
library(zoo)
```

The file "zpresidents.RData" was created in an earlier example.

```{r}
load("zpresidents.RData")
```

```{r}
zpresidents_1 <- zpresidents[1:4]
zpresidents_2 <- zpresidents[3:6]
zpresidents_1 + zpresidents_2
```

```{r}
presidents_1 <- presidents[1:4]
presidents_2 <- presidents[3:6]
presidents_1 + presidents_2
```
