# Modifying data with the *dplyr* package


The following makes use of the *dplyr* package. You may need to install it
from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dplyr) using the code
`install.packages("dplyr")` if you want to run this on your computer. (The package is already installed on
the notebook container, however.)

```{r}
options(jupyter.rich_display=FALSE) # Create output as usual in R
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
UK <- data.frame(
           Population = c(55619400,1885400,5424800,3125000),
           Area = c(50301,5460,30090,8023),
           GVA = c(28096,20000,24800,19900),
           country = c("England",
                         "Northern Ireland",
                         "Scotland",
                         "Wales"))
```

```{r}
UK %>% mutate(Density = Population/Area)
```

Equivalent code using 'base' R:

```{r}
within(UK, Density <- Population/Area)
```

```{r}

```
