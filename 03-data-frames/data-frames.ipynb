    "This chapter describes how a typical data set used in multivariate analysis is composed - i.e. as a rectangular arrangement of variables and observations. The chapter further describes ways to manipulate data _within_ data frames and how data frames can be restricted, combined, and reshaped. The chapter also discusses how data in various formats can be imported. Such data formats include CSV, TAB-delimited, and fixed-column files.\n",
